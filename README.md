# TheGamingRoom
•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The client, The Gaming Room, requested that CTS develop a web-based gaming application that could serve multiple platforms. The gaming application would be based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which was only available as an Android application at the time of the request. The requirements for the software consisted of, only one instance of the game could exist in memory at a given time, game and team names must be unique and searchable, each team would be comprised of multiple players, and a game would have the ability to involve more than one team.


•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  For the documentation, I think I did a thorough job researching the options that best served the interests of the client. It is important not to let any bias get in the way when making recommendations since the client will have differing needs. The research, and facts, provided, shows the client that their best interests are at the core of the product.
  
  
•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  An SDT is helpful when developing code since it acts as a guide for what needs to be accomplished. It ensures you are making best use of time and resources as you aren’t guessing what the client wants. The needs have been clearly defined and agreed upon.
  
  
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I could choose one part of my work to revise on the SDT, it would be making it more concise. Improving the statements so that they are short and to the point improves communication between the client and myself. The most important thing I learned from the documentation is to leave nothing to question.


•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the needs of the user for Draw It or Lose It to ensure they had a consistent user experience, ease of use, and that their information was secure. It is important to consider the user’s needs because they are the ones who will be ultimately using the product. If the user isn’t satisfied with the product, or have a good experience, it is likely they won’t play, buy, or show interest in another product by the same company.


•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  My focus for designing the software was to meet the client’s needs and provide the best documentation I could. The documentation of the code will ensure that it can be adapted to other applications in the future. This makes it easy for my future self, or another developer, to understand what each piece of the code does, and how they can use it to meet their needs.
